# Creating an App Instance

The heart of any Rensa project is the Rensa app instance. It is what defines all the routes, Layers, and all other stuff required to start your server.

You can create a new app instance as follows:
```js
import { Rensa } from "rensa";

const app = new Rensa();
```

Now, you can attach as many route definitions and Layers (middlewares) to this as you want:
```js
// Layer definition
app.use((req, res, next) => {
	// Layer code
});

// Route definition
app.get("/home", (req, res) => {
	// Request handler
});

// Start the server
app.listen(3000, () => {
	// Optional code to run on server start
});
```

If you are using *compose* mode, you would need to export this app instance and use it in the config file **rensa.config.js**:
```js
// Export app instance
export app;

// rensa.config.js
export default {
	...
	app: app
	...
}
```
