# Manual Mode
Rensa comes with a *manual* mode, in which the user has complete control over every aspect of their app and folder structure.

In *manual* mode, the user would decide which files would hold what portion of the server they are building.

**Think**, an experience like using *Express*.

## Configuration Options
Even if you are using *manual* mode, you can still get advantage of Rensa's config file. In *manual* mode, the following content for **rensa.config.js** would be enough for good developer experience:
```js
export default {
    mode: "manual",
    app: app,
    port: 5000,
}
```

Here, the *app* is the Rensa app instance to which you have defined routes for your server.

With this, you can now use the Rensa CLI for simplifying your developer experience, like starting your server at the defined port with hot reload.

```sh
npx rensa dev
```

We will look into more details of CLI usage in later sections.
