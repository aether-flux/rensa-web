# Request API

Rensa provides a request object (_req_) that extends Node.js’s native HTTP request (_http.IncomingMessage_). This means you can still use all standard properties and methods like _req.method_, _req.url_, and _req.headers_.
In addition to these, Rensa introduces the following custom properties and methods to make request handling easier.

## req.body
Contains the parsed request body.
```js
const username = req.body.username;
const password = req.body.password;
// OR
const { username, password } = req.body;
```
- Works with JSON and application/x-www-form-urlencoded requests.

## req.params
Contains route parameters from dynamic routes.
```js
app.get("/user/:id", (req, res) => {
  const { id } = req.params;
  console.log(`User ID: ${id}`);
});
```
- Extracts values from _:paramName_ in route definitions.

## req.cookies
Stores parsed cookies from the request.
```js
app.get("/", (req, res) => {
  const { sessionId } = req.cookies;
  console.log(sessionId);
});
```
- Requires the built-in Cookies Layer - _app.useBuiltin("cookies")_

## req.session
Stores session data for the request.
```js
app.get("/", (req, res) => {
  req.session.user = "Alice";
  console.log(req.session);
});
```
- Requires the built-in Sessions Layer - _app.useBuiltin("sessions")_

## req.protocol
Returns the request protocol (_http_ or _https_).
```js
console.log(req.protocol);  // "http" or "https"
```
- Detects x-forwarded-proto for reverse-proxy setups.

## req.get(headerName)
Retrieves a specific request header.
```js
const userAgent = req.get("User-Agent");
console.log(userAgent);
```
- Case-insensitive, i.e. _req.get("user-agent")_ works the same.

These custom request properties and methods in Rensa simplify handling request data. Since Rensa extends Node’s HTTP module, you can still access all native request properties like req.method, req.url, and req.headers.
