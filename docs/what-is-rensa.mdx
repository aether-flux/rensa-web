# What is Rensa
**Rensa** is a high-performance, layer-first backend framework built for Node.js with native Rust optimizations under the hood.
It takes inspirations from modern web architectures, combining the simplicity of Express with powerful abstractions like file-based routing, while providing far better developer ergonomics.

## Core Principles
- **Layer-first design**  
  Middleware is treated as a first-class citizen. Define global or route-specific layers with ease.
- **Blazingly fast**  
  Thanks to its Rust-powered route store and efficient request matching, Rensa outperforms many traditional JS frameworks in routing performance.
- **Dual Modes**  
  Choose your workflow:
	- **Manual Mode**: Fully programmatic like Express.
	- **Compose Mode**: File-based routing and config-driven setup for convention over configuration.
- **Minimal & ergonomic**  
  No magic, no overengineering. Rensa sticks to clear patterns with type safety where it matters.

## Why Rensa?

Most Node.js frameworks fall into one of two traps:
- Too low-level (like Express) → You rewrite the same patterns repeatedly.
- Too opinionated (like Next.js backend / NestJS) → You fight the framework.

**Rensa aims to be the perfect middle ground**:  
You get structure *only when you want it*, and full control *when you need it*.

## Built for Builders

Rensa is designed for:
- Backend engineers tired of Express boilerplate.
- Devs who love clean architecture & layered request flows.
- Hackathon warriors who want to spin up things fast *without sacrificing control*.
- TypeScript users looking for safe, readable API routes.

## Key Features

- Layered Middleware Architecture
- Builtin Middleware Presets (CORS, Logger, Sessions, etc.)
- Rust-backed Fast Route Store
- Static File + View Engine Support
- File-based Routing via Compose Mode
- Minimal Rensa CLI for scaffolding projects

Rensa doesn't try to replace your entire stack.  
It focuses on what a backend framework should do best — **handle requests, cleanly and fast**.
