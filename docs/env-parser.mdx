# Environment Variables Layer

## What is this Layer?
The environment variables Layer lets you load values from a .env file directly into process.env. This is helpful for keeping sensitive configuration (like API keys, database URLs, and secrets) out of your source code while still easily accessing them in your project.

## How it Works?
- The Layer reads the .env file placed in the root directory of your project (same directory where you run your server).
- It parses each line in the format _KEY=VALUE_ and loads it into _process.env_.
- After this, you can access those variables anywhere in your code using _process.env.KEY_.

## How to Use in Rensa?
Rensa comes with a utility function names **env()** which parses any *.env* file present in the root of your project.

The function can be used as follows:
```js
import { env } from "rensa/utils";
env();  // Parses .env variables throughout
```

If you have a different file than *.env*, you can specify the file name or path while calling **env()**. For example, if you have an *.env.local* :
```js
import { env } from "rensa/utils";
env(".env.local");
```

**NOTE:**

The name of the file must be relative to the root of your project. For instance, if you have a *.env* file in a *secrets/* directory, you must call the function as follows :
```js
env("./secrets/.env");
// OR
env("secrets/.env");
```

### Example
Suppose you have a _.env_ file in your project root:
```env
PORT=3000
DB_URL=mongodb://localhost:27017/rensa
JWT_SECRET=supersecret123
```

After calling this function, you can use this inside your server code:
```js
console.log(process.env.PORT);        // 3000
console.log(process.env.DB_URL);      // mongodb://localhost:27017/rensa
console.log(process.env.JWT_SECRET);  // supersecret123
```

Thus, your environment variables are now part of your runtime environment.
