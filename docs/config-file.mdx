# The Config File

The heart of a Rensa project is the config file. The config file that Rensa searches for is the **rensa.config.js** in the root of the project.

The contents of a sample generated config file are as follows:
```js
export default {
  // Mode of using Rensa. "compose" means automatic file-based routing. Switch to "manual" for complete control.
  mode: "compose",
  // OR
  // mode: "manual",

  // In manual mode, you must provide your app instance here, to enable using commands like 'npx rensa run'.
  // Export the app instance from your main file (export const app = new Rensa()).
  // app: app,

  // Directory where routes will be defined (for "compose" mode). If nothing is provided, default is "routes/".
  // routesDir: "routes",

  // Directory where layers will be defined (for "compose" mode). If nothing is provided, Layers won't get applied by default.
  // layersDir: "layers/global",

  // Apply any layers manually (works in "compose" mode only)
  // layers: [[layerFn1, { scope: ["/"] }], [layerFn2, { scope: ["/home"] }]],

  // Builtin Layers (if any) (works in "compose" mode only)
  // builtins: [["logger"], ["rate limiter", 60000, 20]],

  // Set view engine and views directory
  // If 'views' is provided, you must provide a 'viewEngine' as well. Available engines: 'ejs'
  // viewEngine: 'ejs',
  // views: 'views',    // Optional if you provide 'viewEngine', defaults to 'views'

  // Load static files
  // staticDir: 'public',

  // Port where the server would listen to. Must be provided.
  port: process.env.PORT || 5000,
}
```
Let's go through each of these options one by one.

### mode
This defines how Rensa is going to be used in the project. That is, whether you will use Rensa manually, like Express, or enable the file-based routing mode where the routes are defined through the file system (like Next.js routing).

**mode** can be either one of the following:
- *manual*: Normal mode, you define everything manually for Rensa (for eg, Express-like usage)
- *compose*: File-based routing mode, the routes are defined by the files and folders (for eg, like Next.js usage)

**Note:** Of the multiple options in the config object, except **port**, all the other ones will only be effective if the mode is set as *compose*. 

### app
This takes the Rensa app instance, which is required in *manual* mode in order to use CLI commands like **npx rensa dev**.
Example:
```js
// New app instance
const app = new Rensa();
app.get("/", (req, res) => {
	res.send({msg: "Hello, Rensa" });
});

// rensa.config.js
export {
	mode: "manual",
	app: app,
	port: 5000,
}
```

### routesDir
This field defines the name of the directory in the root of the project which houses all the route definitions. This is needed only in *compose* mode.

The default value of **routesDir** is *"routes"*.

When the value of **routesDir** is "routes", it expects a file system of the following form:
```files
routes/
-- get.js        // GET /
-- notFound.js   // 404 page
-- home/
---- get.js      // GET /home
---- get[id].js  // GET /home/:id
```

### layersDir
This is similar to **routesDir**, but this defines the name of the directory which houses the global middlewares/Layers.
By default, this has no value, and thus no global layers are automatically applied from any directory.

For example, if the **layersDir** is set to *"layers/global"*, Rensa expects the following file structure:
```files
-- layers/
---- global/
------ layer1.js  // Returns a Layer object (We'll get to exporting Layers later)
```

### layers & builtins
These two fields define the Layers and Builtin-Layers to a *compose*-mode Rensa project directly through the config file. By default, they have no value.

**layers** takes an array of Layers, while **builtins** takes an array of Builtins.

Example usage:
```js
// Layers
layers: [[layerFn1, { scope: ["/"] }], [layerFn2, { scope: ["/home"] }]],

// Builtins
builtins: [["logger"], ["rate limiter", 60000, 2]],
```

### viewEngine & views
These two fields define the view engine and views directory of a Rensa project. By default, they have no value.

There are some rules to these two fields however:
- If **viewEngine** is provided, manually adding a **views** field is not essential, as it would default to "views".
- However, if **views** is provided, a **viewEngine** field must be manually provided, otherwise the project won't run.

**Note**: Available view engines: **ejs**.

### staticDir
This field defines the directory which houses static files for loading. By default, this has no value.

For example, if you want to access your static files like image assets and fonts, place them in the *public/* directory, and add this line to your config:
```js
staticDir: "public",
```

### port
This is an essential and compulsory field that must be provided for your Rensa project to run successfully. The value provided as **port** is the port at which your server will be running when started. 

For example, if the **port** is defined as :
```js
port: 5000,
```
Then, your server will be started on *http://localhost:5000*.
