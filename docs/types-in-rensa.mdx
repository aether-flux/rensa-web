# Types in Rensa

Rensa provides custom *Request* and *Response* types that extend the core Node.js HTTP interfaces, and also its own *Handler* and *Layer* types, giving you additional utilities out of the box for building web apps more effectively.

These types are especially useful when working in Typescript projects.

## Accessing the Types

If you're using Typescript in your project, you can import the types as follows:

```ts
import type { Request, Response, Layer, Handler } from "rensa";
```

## Request Type

The *Request* type extends Node's built-in *IncomingMessage* and adds helpful properties as follows:

### Request Properties

- **body**: any -- Contains the parsed body of the request.
- **get(headerName)**: (string) => string | string[] | null -- Retrieves the value of a specific request header.
- **protocol**: string -- The protocol used (http or https).
- **cookies**: Record&lt;string, string&gt; -- A key-value map of parsed cookies.
- **session**: Record&lt;string, any&gt; -- Session data associated with the request.

## Response Type

The *Response* type extends Node's *ServerResponse* and adds expressive utility methods and properties:

### Response Properties

- **send(data: any)** -- Sends raw data as the HTTP response. *data* can be a text or an object.
- **json(obj: Object)** -- Sends a JSON response with appropriate headers.
- **redirect(url: string, statusCode?: number)** -- Redirects client to the specified URL.
- **status(code: number)** -- Sets the HTTP code for the response.
- **sendFile(path: string)** -- Sends a file as a response.
- **render(view: string, data?: Record&lt;string, any&gt;)** -- Renders a template file using the specified data.

## Example usage in Typescript

```ts
import type { Request, Response } from "rensa";

app.get("/user", (req: Request, res: Response) => {
  const username = req.cookies["username"];
  res.status(200).json({ user: username });
});
```

## Layer Type

The *Layer* type defines middleware functions that can be used with Rensa's routing system.

```ts
export type Layer = (req: Request, res: Response, next: () => void) => void | Promise<void>;
```

A *Layer* function receives the request and response objects along with a *next* function that should be called to pass control to the next middleware in the stack. Layers can be synchronous or return a Promise.

### Layer Example

```ts
import type { Layer } from "rensa";

const loggerMiddleware: Layer = (req, res, next) => {
  console.log(`${req.method} ${req.url}`);
  next();
};

app.use(loggerMiddleware);
```

## Handler Type

The *Handler* type defines route handler functions that process requests and send responses.

```ts
export type Handler = (req: Request, res: Response) => void | Promise<void>;
```

A *Handler* function receives the request and response objects and is responsible for sending a response to the client.

### Handler Example

```ts
import type { Handler } from "rensa";

const getUserProfile: Handler = (req, res) => {
  const userId = req.params.id;
  // Fetch user data
  res.json({ id: userId, name: "Jane Doe" });
};

app.get("/users/:id", getUserProfile);
```

By using these types, you get better development ergonomics, stricter error-checking, and improved editor support when building with Rensa.
