# Dynamic Routing and Route Parameters

Dynamic routes allow you to define URL patterns that can match multiple values using placeholders. These placeholders act as variables, making it possible to handle routes like _/user/1_, _/user/2_ and so on, using a single route definition.

Some applications of using dynamic routes are :
- Fetching details of a specific user (_/user/:id_)
- Viewing a specific post (_/post/:slug_)
- Handling routes where a resource is identified dynamically

## Dynamic Routes in Rensa

In Rensa, you can define dynamic routes using a colon (:) followed by a parameter name. This parameter can be accessed via the [req.params](/docs/request-api) object. For example :
```js
app.get({
    path: "/user/:id"
}, (req, res) => {
  const userId = req.params.id;
  res.send({ msg: `Fetching user with id ${userId}` });
});
```

Example request :
```http
GET /user/42
```
Example response :
```json
{
  "msg": "Fetching user with id 42"
}
```

## Using Multiple Dynamic Parameters

You can also have multiple dynamic route parameters in a single route.

```js
app.get({
    path: "/post/:category/:id"
}, (req, res) => {
  const { category, id } = req.params;
  res.send({ msg: `Fetching post ${id} of category ${category}` });
});
```

Example request :
```http
GET /post/tech/10
```
Example response :
```json
{
  msg: "Fetching post 10 of category tech"
}
```

### Compose Mode
In *compose* mode, dynamic routes can be defined as follows via the file structure:
```files
-- routes/
---- home/
------ get.js        // GET /home
------ get[id].js    // GET /home/:id
------ post[id].js   // POST /home/:id
```

Thus, this makes the process of defining dynamic routes even more friendlier for devs.
We will go in more depth on defining routes in *compose* mode in later sections.
