# Sessions Layer

## What is the Sessions Layer?

The sessions Layer provides a way to store user-specific data across multiple requests. Unlike cookies, session data is stored server-side, with only a _session ID_ sent to the client. This helps in keeping sensitive data secure while allowing stateful interactions.

The sessions Layer may be used when :
- You need to store temporary user data, like authentication data or cart contents.
- You need server-side state management without exposing data in client-side cookies.
- You require automatic sesison expiration after a period of inactivity.

## How to use the Sessions Layer in Rensa?

Rensa's built-in sessions Layer manages session storage internally.

To enable it :
```js
app.useBuiltin("sessions"[, timeout]);
```

**Configuration Options :**
- _timeout_: Determines how long the session will be alive before it expires. Default: _3600000 ms_ (1 hour).

You can pass a custom timeout as follows :
```js
app.useBuiltin("sessions", 30 * 60 * 1000);  // 30*60*1000 ms = 30 minutes
```

To access the session data in routes :
```js
app.get("/dashboard", (req, res) => {
  req.session.views = (req.session.views || 0) + 1;
  res.send({ msg: `You have visited this page ${req.session.views} times.` });
});
```

What this does :
- Each user gets a unique session ID, stored in a session_id cookie.
- The server maintains a session store that maps session IDs to session data.
- If the user has an active session, _req.session_ contains their stored data.
- Sessions expire after a specified timeout (default: 1 hour) to free memory.

**Here's what happens when requests are sent:**

**_First request:_**
```Req_Headers
(No session cookie sent)
```
Server response:
```json
{
  "msg": "You have visited this page 1 times."
}
```

```Res_Headers
Set-Cookie: session_id=abc123; Path=/; HttpOnly
```

**_Second request:_**
```Req_Headers
Cookie: session_id=abc123
```
Server response:
```json
{
  "msg": "You have visited this page 2 times."
}
```

**Session Expiration :** Sessions automatically expire after the configured timeout. When this happens, a new session is created.
