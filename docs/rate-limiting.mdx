# Rate Limiting Layer

## What is Rate Limiting?

Rate limiting controls how many requests a client can make within a specific time period. This helps in preventing abuse, mitigate DDoS attacks, and ensure fair usage of resources.

## How it Works?

- Each client (identified by their IP address) has a request count tracked over a time window.
- If the client exceeds the allowed limit with the time window, they receive a **429 Too Many Requests** response.
- Once the time window resets, the request count is cleared, allowing new requests.

## How to use the Rate Limiting Layer in Rensa?

Rensa comes in with its own built-in Layer for implementing rate limiting. You can enable it as follows :
```js
app.useBuiltin("rate limiter"[, windowMs, maxRequests]);
```

**Configuration options :**

- _windowMs_: Defines the time window for rate limiting. Default: _60000 ms_ (1 minute).
- _maxRequests_: Maximum number of requests allowed within the time window. Default: _10 requests_.

Now, if the server is requested for more than 10 times in a single minute (default config), it returns a **_Error 429:_ Too Many Requests** along with the following response :
```Response
Too many requests, please try again later.
```
