# Views in Compose Mode
As discussed before, Rensa currently supports EJS as a view engine.
Setting and using a view engine in *compose* mode is extremely simple.

## The Config
The config in **rensa.config.js** comes with two options related to views.
- **viewEngine**: Defines which view engine to use.
- **views**: Optional. Defines the directory where the views (eg, .ejs files) are stored.

For example, if you want to use EJS engine, and you have stored your .ejs files in the *views/* directory as follows:
```files
-- views/
---- index.ejs
---- home.ejs
```

Then, you should add the following lines in your config file:
```js
viewEngine: "ejs",
views: "views",
```

Providing a value for *views* is optional, as it defaults to *views/*.

This will enable you to use and render views via your server. Rendering views in routes and sending data is the same as discussed in previous sections.

### Rules
There are some rules to these two options however:
- If **viewEngine** is provided, manually adding a **views** field is not essential, as it would default to "views".
- However, if **views** is provided, a **viewEngine** field must be manually provided, otherwise the project won't run.
