# Presets in Rensa

Presets in Rensa are a way to group multiple Layers together under a single name. These groups (called _Presets_) can then be reused across multiple routes or scopes without repeating the same set of Layer definitions. This makes the code cleaner, easier to maintain, and more modular.

Presets are especially helpful when:
- You frequently use the same group of Layers across different parts of your app
- You want to logically group related Layers together
- You want to scope or reuse grouped Layers easily

## Using Presets in Rensa
Rensa provides two main methods to work with Presets:
1. _app.createPreset(presetName, ...layers);_
2. _app.usePreset(presetName, config?);_

### 1. Creating a Preset
You can create a preset by giving it a name and providing one or more Layer functions. Note that the order of Layers is important; the Layers will be executed in the exact order you provide.
The signature of the function is as follows:
```ts
createPreset(presetName: string, ...layers: Layer[]);
```
Example:
```js
const authLayer = (req, res, next) => {
  // Auth check logic
  next();
};

const validator = (req, res, next) => {
  // Validation logic
  next();
};

// Group both Layers into a single Preset
app.createPreset("secureAccess", authLayer, validator);
```
The _"secureAccess"_ can now be used anywhere in your app.

### 2. Using a Preset
Once created, a preset can be applied using _app.usePreset()_.
```js
app.usePreset("secureAccess");
```

**Scoped Presets**
Just like individual Layers, Presets can also be scoped to specific routes using the scope option.
```js
app.usePreset("secureAccess", { scope: ["/settings", "/admin"] });

app.get("/settings", (req, res) => {
  res.send("Settings page");
});

app.get("/admin", (req, res) => {
  res.send("Admin page");
});
```

## Example: Using Presets for Cleaner Code
Without presets:
```js
app.use(authLayer, validator, { scope: ["/settings", "/admin"] });
```
With presets:
```js
app.createPreset("secureAccess", authLayer, validator);
app.usePreset("secureAccess", { scope: ["/settings", "/admin"] });
```
Presets make your middleware logic easier to reuse and help maintain separation of concerns.

### Important Stuff
- Presets are just named bundles of Layer functions. Internally, they behave like you called _app.use(...layers)_ yourself.
- If a preset name is not found, _app.usePreset()_ silently skips applying anything.
- You can reuse the same preset multiple times in different scopes.
- If needed, you can call _app.createPreset()_ again with the same name to overwrite it.
