# Config via the CLI

In the previous page, we discussed about all the different fields available in the config file **rensa.config.js**. However, writing your own config file from scratch every time while remembering all these various fields would be quite frustrating. 

So, I have added the feature of creating a sample config file using the CLI, which you can edit afterwards as desired.

### Installation
Firstly, you have to install the main Rensa package.
```sh
npm install rensa
```

### Generating rensa.config.js
Now, to generate the config file, we use the *init* command of the *rensa* CLI. Paste the following command in your terminal/command prompt, and it should do the job:
```sh
npx rensa init
```

### Overwriting existing config
If you wish to overwrite any existing **rensa.config.js** with a new and clean default config, you can use the *--force* flag.
```sh
npx rensa init --force
```

This will overwrite any existing config files and give you a clean slate to work on.
