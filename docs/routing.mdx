# Routing in Compose Mode
Say goodbye to the traditional way of routing. When in *compose* mode, routing is done automatically via file structure. It's like **the Next.js for backends**.

## The Config
In the **rensa.config.js** file, there is a field *"routesDir"*. This defines the name of the directory that holds the routes. **By default, it's value is *routes/***.

To use your own directory, you can just edit the line in the config file as follows:
```js
routesDir: "dirName",
```

## Route Definitions
Let's assume the routes directory set in the *compose* mode is *routes/*. To define routes, we would need to create new files with specific naming structures, which would be holding the definitions of a specific route.

For example, let's say we have a file structure as follows:
```files
-- routes/
---- get.js
---- home/
------ get.js
------ get[id].js
------ post.js
```

Through this file structure, we can have a peek into every type of route definitions possible.

### 1. routes/get.js

As this is in the root of the *route/* directory, this file defines the route /. So, the route handler and config that would be present in this file would define the / route. Since the name of the file is *get.js*, so the route defined by this file would be **GET /**.

However, there needs to be a certain kind of object that needs to be exported from this file, for it to be recognized as a route properly. For this purpose, Rensa comes with a helper function, *route()**, which can be used as follows:
```js
// Import the helper function
import { route } from "rensa/compose";

// Export the route definition as default
export default route(handler, config);
```

Here, the *route()* method takes in two arguments, a handler and a config.
- **handler**: As the name suggests, this stores the main request handler for the route. It is of the normal handler type, i.e. Handler.
- **config**: This is an object that takes a field *layers* which is an array of Layers/middlewares that would be specific to the route. Every Layer would be of the type Layer. *This argument is optional.*

An example definition for the / route would be as follows:
```js
import { route } from "rensa/compose";

export default route((req, res) => {
    res.send({ message: "Hello, from Rensa!", path: "/" });
}, {
    layers: [
        (req, res, next) => {
            // Layer processing
            next();
        },
    ]
});
```

This can also be done quite easily in TypeScript:
```ts
import { route } from "rensa/compose";
import type { Request, Response } from "rensa/types";

export default route((req: Request, res: Response) => {
    res.send({ message: "Hello, from Rensa!", path: "/" });
}, {
    layers: [layer1, layer2, ...],
});
```

### 2. routes/home/get.js

Similar to the previous case, this also defines a simple GET route. Since here, the location of the *get.js* file is */home* relative to *routes/*, so this file would define the route **GET /home**.

A simple example of a route definition for */home* would be as follows:
```js
import { route } from "rensa/compose";

export default route((req, res) => {
    res.send({ message: "This is the home page", path: "/home" });
});
```

### 3. routes/home/get[id].js

This is where things get even more interesting. This file is very much similar to the previous example, i.e. routes/home/get.js. However, the *[id]* part here acts as a dynamic parameter. As a result, this file defines the route **GET /home/:id**.

This parameter can then be accessed via req.params, as shown in the following example:
```js
import { route } from "rensa/compose";

export default ((req, res) => {
    res.send({ message: `ID is ${req.params.id} ` });
});
```

This is not limited to just one parameter. For instance, if you want to define the route **GET /home/:id/:name**, you can do so by creating the file **routes/home/get[id][name].js**.

However, the order of the params matter. The file *get[id][name].js* would define */:id/:name*, while the file *get[name][id].js* would define */:name/:id*.

### 4. routes/home/post.js

This is pretty simple and straightforward. Just like the previous files, this defines a route. As the name of the file is *post.js*, so this file would define the route **POST /home**.

An example for a POST route definition can be as follows:
```js
import { route } from "rensa/compose";

export default route((req, res) => {
    const { username, email } = req.body;
    res.send({ message: "Welcome, user!", user: username, email });
});
```

Similarly, other methods (PUT, PATCH, DELETE) routes can be defined using the respective file names (put.js, patch.js, delete.js).

## For TypeScript Devs
If you are using TypeScript, then you need to modify the settings of *routesDir* in the config file slightly. In your case, if the compiled JavaScript code resides in *dist/* directory, you need to specify *routesDir* needs to be set as *"dist/routes"*.

Additionally, in the route files (i.e. get.js or post.js), the default export needs to be explicitly set as a certain type, *ComposeRoute*. The following example definition for the route *GET /home* would explain it better:
```ts
import { route } from "rensa/compose";
import { ComposeRoute } from "rensa/types";

export default route((req, res) => {
    res.send({ message: "Hello, Rensa!", route: "/home" });
}) as ComposeRoute;
```


### Conclusion
That was all about route definition and creation in *compose* mode. In the next section, we will learn more about Layers and auto-applying them in *compose* mode.
