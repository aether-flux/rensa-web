# Compose Mode
Rensa's *compose* mode is a fresh take on backend development.

When using *compose* mode, you get access to a bunch of new features from Rensa, such as :
- File-based routing
- Auto-applying Layers from files
- Managing every aspect of your server from a single config file
- Access to more CLI features

**Think**, an experience like *Next.js* but for backend development.

## Configuration Options
All the fields of the config field are effective in *compose* mode. Thus, there is a vast possibility of things to configure.

Using the CLI, you can spin up a basic config file (**rensa.config.js**):
```sh
npx rensa init
```

The contents of the config file generated through the CLI is as follows:
```js
export default {
  // Mode of using Rensa. "compose" means automatic file-based routing. Switch to "manual" for complete control.
  mode: "compose",
  // OR
  // mode: "manual",

  // In manual mode, you must provide your app instance here, to enable using commands like 'npx rensa run'.
  // Export the app instance from your main file (export const app = new Rensa()).
  // app: app,

  // Directory where routes will be defined (for "compose" mode). If nothing is provided, default is "routes/".
  // routesDir: "routes",

  // Directory where layers will be defined (for "compose" mode). If nothing is provided, Layers won't get applied by default.
  // layersDir: "layers/global",

  // Apply any layers manually (works in "compose" mode only)
  // layers: [[layerFn1, { scope: ["/"] }], [layerFn2, { scope: ["/home"] }]],

  // Builtin Layers (if any) (works in "compose" mode only)
  // builtins: [["logger"], ["rate limiter", 60000, 20]],

  // Set view engine and views directory
  // If 'views' is provided, you must provide a 'viewEngine' as well. Available engines: 'ejs'
  // viewEngine: 'ejs',
  // views: 'views',    // Optional if you provide 'viewEngine', defaults to 'views'

  // Load static files
  // staticDir: 'public',

  // Port where the server would listen to. Must be provided.
  port: process.env.PORT || 5000,
}
```

We will gradually go through every one of these options in the following sections.
