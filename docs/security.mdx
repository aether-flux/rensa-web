# Security Layer

The security headers Layer enhances the security of your application by setting HTTP response headers that help prevent common web vulnerabilities like clickjacking, MIME-type sniffing, and cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.

## How it works?

This built-in Layer works by adding the following headers to every response :
- _X-Content-Type-Options: no-sniff :_  Prevents browsers from MIME-sniffing responses.
- _X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN :_  Blocks the site from being embedded in an iframe on another domain, preventing clickjacking attacks.
- _X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block :_  Enables XSS protection in older browsers.
- _Referrer-Policy: no-referrer :_  Prevents referrer data from being sent to other sites.
- _Permissions-Policy: geolocation(), microphone() :_  Restricts the use of geolocation and microphone APIs in the browser.

## How to use the Security Layer in Rensa?

To enable Rensa's built-in security Layer :
```js
app.useBuiltin("security");
```
This will automatically add all these security headers to all responses of your server, improving your application's security.
