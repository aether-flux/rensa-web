# Layers in Rensa

Rensa's Layer system is a unique take on middlewares, providing a structured way to handle request processing.

Rensa supports two types of Layers that help in processing requests efficiently.

1. **Global Layers (Middlewares for all routes):**
  - These Layers apply to all incoming requests regardless of the route.
  - They are useful for logging, authentication, CORS handling, rate limiting, etc.
2. **Route-Specific Layers:**
  - These Layers apply only to specific routes, allowing fine-grained control over request processing.
  - They are useful for input validation, role-based access control, custom request handlers, etc.
