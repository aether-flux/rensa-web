# Built-in Layers

Rensa comes with a set of built-in Layers that handle common tasks like CORS handling, logging requests, etc. These Layers save you time by providing ready-to-use solutions without any need of external dependencies.

## What Rensa Provides

Here is a list of all the built-in Layers that Rensa comes with :
1. .env Parsing
2. CORS Handling
3. Cookies
4. Sessions
5. Rate Limiting
6. Request Logging
7. Security

## How to use Built-in Layers

### 1. Manual Mode
To use built-in Layers in *manual* mode, use the following syntax :
```ts
app.useBuiltin(layerName: string, ...args: any[][, config?: LayerConfig]);
```

### 2. Compose Mode
To use built-in Layers in *compose* mode, use the following field in the config file:
```js
layers: [Builtins[]],

// where every Builtin element would be of the type:
[ "builtin name", ...args, config?: LayerConfig ]
```

For example, to use the "rate limiter" Layer scoped to the "/home" route, we can write:
```js
layers: [["rate limiter", 60000, 2, { scope: ["/home"] }]],
```

We will dive deeper into the various Builtin Layers that Rensa provides.
