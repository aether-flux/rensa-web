# Compose Mode
Rensa provides some helper functions to help with development in *compose* mode.

## Functions

### 1. route()

This method is used to define routes in *compose* mode. In a route file, say *routes/get.js*, the definition for the route needs to be exported as follows:
```js
import { route } from "rensa/compose";

export default route((req, res) => {
    // Route Handler
});
```

The function signature of **route()** is:
```ts
route(handler: Handler, config?: ComposeRouteConfig);
```
where the ComposeRouteConfig is a non-user-facing type which is defined as follows:
```ts
interface ComposeRouteConfig = {
    layers?: Layer[],
};
```

So, *config* is an optional argument which can be passed if you need to set any layer as specific to that route.

For instance, if I have an auth checking Layer that I want to tie specifically to the route *GET /profile*, I will create a file **routes/profile/get.js** with the following contents:
```js
import { route } from "rensa/compose";

const authLayer = (req, res, next) => {
    // Check auth status
    next();
};

export default route((req, res) => {
    // Handle GET /profile
}, {
    layers: [authLayer],
});
```

### 2. layer()

If you are using the feature of auto-applying Layers from a specific directory (say, *layers/global/*), then in every file in that directory, you would need to export the Layer in a proper format. That is where this helper function comes in play.

The function signature for this method is:
```ts
layer(layerFn: Layer, config?: LayerConfig);
```

Here, LayerConfig is another non-user-facing type that holds the configuration details of a Layer:
```ts
interface LayerConfig = {
    scope?: string[];
};
```

Let's say we have to develop a Layer that checks for auth status, and then scope this Layer to the */profile* routes. To achieve this, we would need to first set the layersDir as *layers/global* in the config file:
```js
// FILE -- rensa.config.js
layersDir: "layers/global",
```

Now, we need to create a file in *layers/global* with any name, say *authStatus.js*, which needs to have the following content:
```js
import { layer } from "rensa/compose";

export default layer((req, res, next) => {
    // Check auth status
    next();
}, {
    scope: ["/profile"],
});
```

This would automatically attach this auth Layer to our server while running it, scoping it to only */profile* routes, just as we intended.
