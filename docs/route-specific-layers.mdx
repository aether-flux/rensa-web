# Route-Specific Layers

Route-specific Layers in Rensa are middleware functions that apply only to a specific route. These Layers allow execution of custom logic before the route handler runs, making them useful for tasks like authentication, validation or role-based access control.

Route-specific Layers may be used in the following scenarios :
- Protect certain routes with authentication
- Validate request parameters or body before processing
- Apply custom logic to only specific routes (ex, rate limiting for login routes)

## Route-Specific Layers in Rensa

There are two ways of defining route-specific Layers in Rensa.

### 1. Using the method handler directly

To use a Layer as route-specific for a certain route, pass the Layer functions before the route handler during defining the route using _.get()_, _.post()_ etc. The parameters for the Layer function still remain the same, ie req (request), res (response) and next.

For example, to protect a route with authorization :
```js
// Layer/Middleware function
const authMiddleware = (req, res, next) => {
  if (!req.headers.authorization) {
    return res.status(401).send({ error: "Unauthorized" });
  }
  
  next();
};

// Applying the Layer to a specific route
app.get({
    path: "/dashboard",
    layers: [authMiddleware]
}, (req, res) => {
  res.send({ message: "Welcome to your dashboard!" });
})

// Start the server
app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log("Server is running...");
});
```

If the user is unauthorized, they will get the response as follows :
```json
{
  "error": "Unauthorized"
}
```
While an authorized user will be able to receive this response :
```json
{
  "message": "Welcome to your dashboard!"
}
```

### 2. Scoping Layers to target specific routes
If there are more than one routes where a Layer is to be applied, then it can be achieved in a simpler way by defining the scope of the Layer at the time of using it.
```js
const authLayer = (req, res, next) => {
  // Auth-specific code
  next();
};

app.use(authLayer, { scope: ["/dashboard", "/profile"] });

app.get("/dashboard", (req, res) => {
  // Handler for /dashboard
});

app.get("/profile", (req, res) => {
  // Handler for /profile
});
```

This removes the need to manually attach the same Layer to multiple routes as follows:
```js
app.get("/dashboard", authLayer, (req, res) => {
  // Handler for /dashboard
});

app.get("/profile", authLayer, (req, res) => {
  // Handler for /profile
});
```

**You can also use multiple Layers at once and scope them together:**
```js
const authLayer = (req, res, next) => {
 // Auth-specific code
};

const validator = (req, res, next) => {
  // Validation code
};

app.use(validator, authLayer, { scope: ["/dashboard", "/profile"] });
```

## Compose Mode
If you are in *compose* mode, you can set a folder, say **layers/global/**, where every file would export a Layer:
```js
// FILE -- rensa.config.js
layersDir: "layers/global",

// FILE -- layers/global/layer1.js
import { layer } from "rensa/compose";

// Define Layer as route-specific
export default layer((req, res, next) => {
    // Layer handler
    console.log("Layer stuff");
    next();
}, { scope: ["/home"] });
```

This will automatically apply this function as a Layer/middleware in your Rensa server.
We will learn more about exporting Layers in *compose* mode in later sections.

### Some Important Stuff

- Route-specific Layers only affect the route they are attached to.
- Multiple Layers can be applied by chaining the functions using next().
- If a Layer doesn't call next(), the request will be halted or paused at that point.
