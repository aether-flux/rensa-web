# Route-Specific Layers

Route-specific Layers in Rensa are middleware functions that apply only to a specific route. These Layers allow execution of custom logic before the route handler runs, making them useful for tasks like authentication, validation or role-based access control.

Route-specific Layers may be used in the following scenarios :
- Protect certain routes with authentication
- Validate request parameters or body before processing
- Apply custom logic to only specific routes (ex, rate limiting for login routes)

## Route-Specific Layers in Rensa

To define route-specific Layers, pass the Layer functions before the route handler during defining the route using _.get()_, _.post()_ etc. The parameters for the Layer function still remain the same, ie req (request), res (response) and next.

For example, to protect a route with authorization :
```js
// Layer/Middleware function
const authMiddleware = (req, res, next) => {
  if (!req.headers.authorization) {
    return res.status(401).send({ error: "Unauthorized" });
  }
  
  next();
};

// Applying the Layer to a specific route
app.get("/dashboard", authMiddleware, (req, res) => {
  res.send({ message: "Welcome to your dashboard!" });
})

// Start the server
app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log("Server is running...");
});
```

If the user is unauthorized, they will get the response as follows :
```json
{
  "error": "Unauthorized"
}
```
While an authorized user will be able to receive this response :
```json
{
  "message": "Welcome to your dashboard!"
}
```

### Some Important Stuff

- Route-specific Layers only affect the route they are attached to.
- Multiple Layers can be applied by chaining the functions using next().
- If a Layer doesn't call next(), the request will be halted or paused at that point.
