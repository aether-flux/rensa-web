# Serving Static Files in Rensa

While Rensa doesnâ€™t have built-in static file serving (yet ðŸ‘€), you can still serve static files like images, CSS, and JavaScript using a simple middleware.

## Why Serve Static Files?

Web applications often need to serve static assets like :
- Stylesheets (ex, CSS) for designing the frontend
- Javascript files for interactivity
- Images (png, jpg, svg, etc)
- Fonts and other static assets

Since Rensa doesnâ€™t automatically serve these files, you can create a middleware to handle it.

## How to serve Static Files in Rensa?

Here's how you can create a simple Layer to serve static files from a _public_ folder :
```js
import fs from "fs";
import path from "path";

app.use((req, res, next) => {
  if (req.url.startsWith("/public/")) {
    const filePath = path.join(process.cwd(), req.url);
    fs.readFile(filePath, (err, data) => {
      if (err) {
        res.statusCode = 404;
        return res.end("File not found");
      }
      res.end(data);
    });
  } else {
    next();
  }
});
```

## How it works?

- This Layer/middleware checks if the request URL starts with _/public/_.
- If it does, it tries to read the corresponding file from the project directory.
- If the file exists, it sends it as a response.
- If the file doesn't exist, it returns a **_Error 404:_ File not found**.
- If the request isnâ€™t for a static file, it moves on to the next Layer or route handler.

## Using this Layer

Save your static files in the _public_ folder (or whichever directory you have specified) :

```Files
/project-root
 â”œâ”€â”€ public
 â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ styles.css
 â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ script.js
 â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ image.png
 â”œâ”€â”€ index.js
```

Now, you can access these files in the browser as follows :
- http://localhost:3000/public/styles.css
- http://localhost:3000/public/script.js
- http://localhost:3000/public/image.png

This method works as a temporary solution. In future updates, Rensa might include built-in static file handling to make this process easier.
