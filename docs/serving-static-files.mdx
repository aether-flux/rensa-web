# Serving Static Files in Rensa

Rensa has a nice and simple-to-use API to automatically serve static files through the app instance we created.

## Why Serve Static Files?

Web applications often need to serve static assets like :
- Stylesheets (ex, CSS) for designing the frontend
- Javascript files for interactivity
- Images (png, jpg, svg, etc)
- Fonts and other static assets

Since these files are not automatically served, you can use one of the following two ways to serve the files.

## 1. Manual Mode (*app.static()*)

If you are in *manual* mode, you can use the **static()** method to serve static files.

This method can be used via the following syntax :
```js
// App instance
const app = new Rensa();

// Serving static files
app.static();
```

By default, it serves static files from the *public/* directory. This means that, in your project root, files present in the *public/* directory would get served through this code.

Suppose you have these files in the *public/* directory :

```Files
/project-root
 ├── public
 │   ├── styles.css
 │   ├── script.js
 │   ├── image.png
 ├── index.js
```

Now, you can access these files in the browser as follows :
- http://localhost:3000/public/styles.css
- http://localhost:3000/public/script.js
- http://localhost:3000/public/image.png

If you wish to serve files from a different directory, you can specify that as follows:
```ts
app.static(folder: string);
```

*folder* is a string which contains the name of the directory from where static files are to be searched.

**NOTE:**

The directory mentioned in *folder* must be relative to the project root. For instance, if *folder* is set as *static_dir*, it would look for the directory *project-root/static_dir/*.

**NOTE :**

*folder* should only be the name of the directory and not start with any character that is not an alphabet. For instance, *assets/static* is a valid name for *folder*, but *./assets/static* or *./public* are not valid.

## 2. Compose Mode
In *compose* mode, setting a static directory is extremely simple.

Assuming that your static files are in a directory named *public/*, you can serve these files with this one line in the config file:
```js
staticDir: "public",
```

Of course, you can now replace *"public"* with whatever directory you are storing your static files in. The rules for this string are the same as what we discussed above for *folder* in *manual* mode.
