# Static Files and Views

## Serving Static Files

Serving static files using the app instance is extremely simple. The Rensa app instance comes with a method **static()** which automatically loads all static files and makes it ready to use for the server.

This method can be used via the following syntax :
```js
// App instance
const app = new Rensa();

// Serving static files
app.static();
```

By default, it serves static files from the *public/* directory. This means that, in your project root, files present in the *public/* directory would get served through this code.

Suppose you have these files in the *public/* directory :

```Files
/project-root
 ├── public
 │   ├── styles.css
 │   ├── script.js
 │   ├── image.png
 ├── index.js
```

Now, you can access these files in the browser as follows :
- http://localhost:3000/public/styles.css
- http://localhost:3000/public/script.js
- http://localhost:3000/public/image.png

If you wish to serve files from a different directory, you can specify that as follows:
```ts
app.static(folder: string);
```

*folder* is a string which contains the name of the directory from where static files are to be searched.

**NOTE:**

The directory mentioned in *folder* must be relative to the project root. For instance, if *folder* is set as *static_dir*, it would look for the directory *project-root/static_dir/*.

**NOTE :**

*folder* should only be the name of the directory and not start with any character that is not an alphabet. For instance, *assets/static* is a valid name for *folder*, but *./assets/static* or *./public* are not valid.

## Using a View Engine

Rensa supports EJS as a templating engine for rendering dynamic HTML pages.

### Setting the View Engine

To set a view engine :
```js
app.viewEngine(engine[, folder]);
```
- _engine (string) :_ The name of the view engine.
- _folder (string, optional) :_ The folder containing the views. Defaults to "views".

To use EJS :
```js
app.viewEngine("ejs"[, "views"]);
```

### Creating an EJS Template

Inside your project, create a views folder and make an _index.ejs_ file :
```Files
/project-root
 ├── views
 │   ├── index.ejs
 ├── index.js
```

### Rendering a View/Template

To render a view, use the _res.render()_ method as follows :
```js
res.render(view[, data={}]);
```
- _view (string) :_ The name of the template/view file.
- _data (object, optional) :_ Dynamic data to be passed to the view (if any).

For example, to render _index.ejs_ :
```js
app.get("/", (req, res) => {
  res.render("index", { name: "Rensa User" });
});
```
