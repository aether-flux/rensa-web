# Layers and Builtins in Compose Mode

When you are building in *compose* mode, you have two choices for applying Layers to your server. You can either directly apply Layers to your server via the config file, or you can define a directory where every file would be defining a Layer and Rensa would auto-attach all Layers in that specific directory.

Let's go through both the methods one by one.

## 1. Attach Layers and Builtins Directly
If there are very few Layers needed for your server, this method is recommended.

### I. Layers
The **rensa.config.js** file has the *layers* field, which takes an array of Layers, where every element of this array is also an array, with the following members:
- *the Layer itself*: The first member of the Layer array is the Layer function itself. This is necessary to be provided.
- *the Layer config*: The second member of the array is the Layer config. If you wish to scope a Layer to some specific routes, you can do that here via tha Layer config. This member is optional to provide.

For example:
```js
// Layer definition
const layer1 = (req, res, next) => {
    // Layer processing
    next();
};

const layer2 = (req, res, next) => {
    // Layer processing
    next();
};

// FILE -- rensa.config.js
layers: [
    [layer1],                       // Attach layer1 as a global Layer
    [layer2, { scope: "/home" }]    // Attach layer2 as Layer scoped to /home
],
```

### II. Builtins
Builtin Layers can only be applied directly, as file-based application is not available for them. For builtins, the config object has a field *builtins*, which takes in an array of Builtins. Each member of this array is also an array, whose members are as follows:
- *builtin name*: This is essential to provide. This contains the name of the builtin Layer in string. For example, "logger" or "rate limiter".
- *builtin args*: These are the arguments to be passed to the builtin Layer. The requirement for this depends on the builtin itself.
- *config*: This is the last element of the array, and may or may not be provided. This is the same as config for a Layer, i.e. this scopes the builtin to specific routes.

Example usage of builtins in the config file can be as follows:
```js
builtins: [
    ["logger", { scope: ["/home"] }],
    ["rate limiter", 60000, 2],
],
```

## 2. Auto-Applying Layers from Files
This is the interesting part of this section. Just like with routes, you can auto apply Layers from file structure as well. For this, you need to define the *layersDir* field in **rensa.config.js**.
```js
layersDir: "layers/global",
```

Now, every file in *layers/global/* will export a Layer, which will automatically get applied to the server.

However, the files can't just be exporting anything. Just like routes, Rensa also comes with a helper function **layer()** for exporting from Layer files.

This **layer()** method takes in two arguments:
- **layer function**: This is the main Layer function itself. This is compulsory.
- **layer config**: This is the config for the Layer. You can set a config for the Layer if you want to scope the Layer to specific routes. This is optional.

To better understand this, let's create a file *layers/global/logLayer.js*:
```js
import { layer } from "rensa/compose";

// Only the Layer (set globally)
export default layer((req, res, next) => {
    console.log(`${req.method} - ${req.url}`);
    next();
});

// Scope Layer with a config
export default layer((req, res, next) => {
    console.log(`${req.method} - ${req.url}`);
    next();
}, {
    scope: ["/home"],
});
```

## For TypeScript Devs
If you are using TypeScript, then you need to modify the settings of *layersDir* in the config file slightly. In your case, if the compiled JavaScript code resides in *dist/* directory, you need to specify *layersDir* needs to be set as *"dist/layers/global"*.

Additionally, in the layer files, the default export needs to be explicitly set as a certain type, *ComposeLayer*. The following example definition for the auth Layer would explain it better:
```ts
import { layer } from "rensa/compose";
import { ComposeLayer } from "rensa/types";

export default layer((req, res, next) => {
    // Auth processing
    next();
}) as ComposeLayer;
```

### Conclusion

This is how Layers can be auto applied from files. Similarly, you can define as many files as you wish in *layers/global* or the directory you defined as *layersDir*, and every one of them would get automatically applied as Layers to your server.

In the next section, we will explore about how to serve static files.
