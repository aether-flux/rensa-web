# How Rensa Handles Requests?

At its core, Rensa follows a layered request processing model, allowing you to efficiently handle incoming HTTP requests and send structured responses.

Here's a high-level breakdown :

1. **Request Entry:**
  - A client sends an HTTP request (ex, GET /users).
  - Rensa's router parses the request path and determines the correct handler.
2. **Middleware Execution (Layers):**
  - Middlewares (called Layers in Rensa) runs in a sequential order before the request reaches the route handler.
  - This allows for modular pre-processing, such as authentication, logging, or request transformation.
3. **Route Handler Execution:**
  - The assigned handler processes the request and prepares a response.
  - Handlers can be asynchronous and can interact with databases, external services, etc.
4. **Response Finalization:**
  - Headers, status codes and body data are finalized before transmission.
