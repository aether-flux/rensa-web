# Quick Start Guide

Welcome to **Rensa** — a flexible and modern backend framework with two modes of development:
- **Compose Mode (Recommended)**: File-based routing and advanced CLI features, structured like frontend meta frameworks (eg, Next.js)
- **Manual Mode**: Direct control, code-as-you-go. Inspired by frameworks like Express.

Let's get started with the fastest and preferred way: **compose** mode.

## 1. Create a New Project
To scaffold a new project quickly, use the CLI as follows:
```sh
npx create-rensa-app@latest
```
Choose the **Compose** template when prompted.

This sets up a project with:
- File-based routing (routes/)
- Optional file-based Layers
- Full access to CLI tools (eg, creating routes from the Rensa CLI)

## 2. Folder Structure
By default, the route *GET /*  is defined. The folder structure is as follows:

```files
my-app/
├── routes/
│   └── get.js
├── rensa.config.js
└── index.js
```

## 3. Start the Dev Server
To see the server up and running, run the following command:
```sh
npx rensa dev
```

The server will be started on **http://localhost:5000/**.

**Congrats!** You have successfully created your first Rensa server.

## Optional: Manual Mode
If you prefer defining routes and Layers manually, you can use the *manual* mode.

```sh
npx create-rensa-app@latest
```
Select the **Manual** template when prompted to set up a Rensa project in *manual* mode.

You will find a *src/index.js* in your project root with the following contents:
```js
import { Rensa } from "rensa";

const app = new Rensa();
// const PORT = process.env.PORT || 5000;

app.get({
  path: "/",
}, (req, res) => {
  res.send({ message: "Hello, Rensa!", route: "/" });
});

// app.listen(PORT, () => {
//   console.log(`Server started on port ${PORT}...`);
// });


export default app;
```

You may un-comment the *app.listen()* lines if you wish to run the server through the following command:
```sh
node src/index.js
```

However, you can opt for a simpler method: **the Rensa CLI**. Don't touch anything commented out, and just run:
```sh
npx rensa dev
```

And voila! Your server is up and running at **http://localhost:5000/**.
