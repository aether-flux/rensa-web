# The Rensa CLI

The Rensa CLI is a CLI tool to quickly scaffold a Rensa project in pre-defined templates. It helps you set up a new Rensa project without the hassle of manual work.

## Usage

Run the following command to start up the CLI :
```npm
npx rensa
```

This will prompt you for the following information :
- **Project Name :** The name of your Rensa project. Default: _rensa-app_
- **Template :** The template to be used. Default: _Basic_

## Templates

There are currently two templates available.

### 1. Basic

This template comes with the bare minimum for a project. This is best for small projects or testing purposes.

It comes with the following files :
```Files
/project-root
 ├── index.js
 ├── package.json
 ├── package-lock.json
```

### 2. Standard

This template provides a well-defined folder structure for better management and scalability. This is better suited for bigger projects.

This template comes with the following:
```Files
/project-root
 ├── src
 │   ├── controllers
 │   ├── routes
 │   ├── views
 │   ├── models
 ├── package.json
 ├── package-lock.json
```
