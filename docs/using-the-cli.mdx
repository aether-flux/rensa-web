# Rensa CLI
Rensa comes with a built-in CLI tool to help with the developer experience while using Rensa.

## What is a CLI?
A CLI (Command Line Interface) is a tool or a command that executes in the terminal/command prompt and is able to do various things related to your project and your system. A CLI can do practically anything, starting from scanning your system to display certain information to directly modifying and managing your system.

The Rensa CLI comes with a set of commands that simplifies a bunch of stuff like generating a config file, creating new routes, etc.

## Using the CLI in Manual Mode
Not every feature of the Rensa CLI is available to use in *manual* mode. For example, creating routes via the CLI is not possible in manual mode.

As we have discussed previously, the config for *manual* mode is as follows:
```js
export default {
    mode: "manual",
    app: app,
    port: 5000,
}
```

This config is essential for Rensa CLI to work properly, as this is the minimum data and context that the CLI requires to function as intended. In *manual* mode, the following commands are available:
- **init**: New config file generation
- **run** and **dev**: Starts the server on the specified port

## Using the CLI in Compose Mode
If you are using *compose* mode, you are in luck, as every command of Rensa CLI can be used properly as intended in compose mode.

As discussed before, the *app* instance is not required to be passed to the config, as in *manual* mode. This is because in *compose* mode, the Rensa CLI creates its own app instance at the time of starting the server.

The following commands are available in this mode:
- **init**: New config file generation
- **run** and **dev**: Starts the server on the specified port
- **route**: Create new route in the specified routes/ directory
- **routes**: List all currently defined routes in the server

We will learn about every command available in the Rensa CLI in detail in the next section.
