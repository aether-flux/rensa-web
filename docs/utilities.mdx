# Utility Functions in Rensa
Rensa comes with some utility and helper functions that simplify some tasks that usually require third party packages.

As of right now, Rensa has one utility function: **env()**.

## Functions

### env()

This method populates the *process.env* object with data obtained from your local .env file. This function can be called as follows:
```js
import { env } from "rensa/utils";

env();
```

The function signature of **env()** is:
```ts
env(file?: string): void;
```

Here, **file** is an optional argument, which may or may not be provided.

1. If no value for **file** is provided, **env()** looks for a *.env* file in your project root and populates *process.env* with values found in that file.
2. If you have another file where your secret keys are stored, you need to pass the file name as **file** while calling this method.

For instance, if you have stored your keys in a *.env.local* file, you need to call this method as follows:
```js
env(".env.local");
```

**RULES:**<br/>
- The name of the file must be relative to your project root. For example, if you have a *.env* file in a *secrets/* directory, you must call the method as follows:
```js
env("./secrets/.env");
// OR
env("secrets/.env");
```

### Example
Suppose you have a _.env_ file in your project root:
```env
PORT=3000
DB_URL=mongodb://localhost:27017/rensa
JWT_SECRET=supersecret123
```

After calling this function, you can use this inside your server code:
```js
console.log(process.env.PORT);        // 3000
console.log(process.env.DB_URL);      // mongodb://localhost:27017/rensa
console.log(process.env.JWT_SECRET);  // supersecret123
```

Thus, your environment variables are now part of your runtime environment.
