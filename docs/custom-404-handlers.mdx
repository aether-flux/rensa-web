# Custom 404 Handlers
When a client requests a route that doesn't exist in your application, Rensa returns a default 404 response. Custom 404 handlers allow you to override this default behavior and provide your own logic for handling "Not Found" scenarios.

Some applications of custom 404 handlers are :
- Displaying user-friendly error pages
- Returning JSON responses for API endpoints
- Logging missing routes
- Redirecting users to relevant content

## Setting a Custom 404 Handler in Rensa
In Rensa, you can define a custom 404 handler using the _notFound()_ method on your app instance. This method accepts a handler function that is called when no matching route is found.
```js
app.notFound((req, res) => {
  res.status(404).send({
    error: "Not Found",
    message: `The requested URL ${req.url} is not found on this server.`
  })
})
```

Example request :
```http
GET /non-existent-route
```

Example response :
```json
{
  "error": "Not Found",
  "message": "The requested URL /non-existent-route is not found on this server."
}
```

## Rendering Custom Error Pages
You can also use Rensa's view engine to render custom error pages :
```js
app.notFound((req, res) => {
  res.status(404);
  await res.render("errors/404", {
    url: req.url,
    title: "Page not found"
  });
});
```
