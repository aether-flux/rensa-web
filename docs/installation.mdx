# Installation

There are two ways of installing and using Rensa in your projects.

## 1. Manual
You can download the npm package as follows:
```bash
npm install rensa
```


Then, you can quickly spin up a basic project using this boilerplate code:
```js
import {Rensa} from "rensa";

const app = new Rensa();
const port = process.env.PORT || 3000;

app.get("/", (req, res) => {
  // Write handler for the route here
  res.send({url: "/", message: "Hello, Rensa!"});
});

app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Server started on port ${port}...`);
});
```

## 2. CLI
You can alternatively use the CLI to quickly get started with one of the available templates.

There are two templates currently available:
- **Manual**: Spins up a boilerplate project with Rensa in *manual* mode.
- **Compose**: Spins up a boilerplate project with Rensa in *compose* mode.

You can use the CLI directly by running:
```sh
npx create-rensa-app
```

Alternatively, you can globally install the installation CLI for any number of uses anytime:
```sh
npm install -g create-rensa-app
create-rensa-app
```

Running this CLI would list a variety of options like your project name and the template you want, and it will create a brand new project for you in Rensa in your preferred template.
