# Introduction to the API Reference

Rensa provides a simple and efficient API to handle server-side routing, Layers (middlewares), and response handling. This section covers all available methods and properties in Rensa.

## Creating a Rensa App

To start using Rensa, create a new instance of the framework :
```js
const app = new Rensa();
```

This initializes the Rensa server instance, allowing you to define routes, apply Layers, and serve responses.

## Basic Setup

Before defining routes, ensure you have a basic server file set up :
```js
import { Rensa } from "rensa";

const app = new Rensa();
```

At this point, the app is initialized but not running. Next, we will define routes and start the server.
